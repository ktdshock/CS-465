Over the course of this project, I developed a full stack web application that includes both a customer-facing interface and a secure administrative panel. This application used a combination of Express HTML for simple, server-rendered pages, JavaScript for dynamic client-side behavior, and a single-page application (SPA) built with Angular to enhance the user experience by avoiding full-page reloads. The SPA offered a more seamless and responsive interaction, while the server-rendered pages allowed for quicker initial loads and simpler implementation for certain admin-side tasks. By combining both types of frontend development, I was able to explore the strengths and trade-offs of each method.

For the backend, I used a NoSQL MongoDB database. This was a strategic choice because MongoDB works well with JavaScript-based applications and offers a flexible document structure that adapts easily to changing data needs. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB allows for storing complex data types like arrays and nested objects, which simplified data modeling for this project. It also integrates naturally with Node.js, making it easier to send and receive data in JSON format throughout the stack.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) played a crucial role in connecting the frontend and backend. While JavaScript is a programming language, JSON is a lightweight data format that uses a syntax similar to JavaScript object literals. JSON allowed my application to structure and transfer data between the frontend and backend in a way that both could understand. For example, when a user submitted a form, the frontend sent the input as a JSON object to the backend API, which then processed it and stored it in the database. This structure made the full stack development process more streamlined and consistent.

Throughout the project, I found multiple opportunities to refactor code. For instance, I created reusable UI components in Angular such as a location card and a form modal. These components helped maintain a consistent look and feel across the site while reducing repetition in the code. Refactoring also improved performance and readability. For example, I reorganized the API routes in the Node backend to follow RESTful principles, which made it easier to manage and test individual endpoints.

When it came to testing, I used both manual and automated methods to verify that requests and data retrieval worked correctly. API endpoints were tested using tools like Postman to simulate GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Adding JWT-based authentication added a layer of complexity, as I had to ensure secure access to protected routes while also making sure authenticated requests worked correctly. Testing became more difficult because protected endpoints required valid tokens, and I had to simulate login flows accurately. I learned how essential it is to structure middleware and route guards properly to maintain security without disrupting application flow.

This course has significantly helped me work toward my professional goals by giving me hands-on experience building a full stack application from start to finish. Iâ€™ve learned how to create RESTful APIs, build SPAs, manage state across the stack, and implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens. These are all essential skills in modern web development, and I now feel more confident in applying for positions that require full stack expertise. This course pushed me to grow in both front-end and back-end development, and it has helped me become a more well-rounded and marketable candidate in the tech industry.# CS-465
